                            I am a dedicated and experienced character illustrator with a focus on producing high-quality artwork for games, books, and album covers. 

                            My artistic journey began with a foundation in Studio Arts from Dawson College, followed by further studies at Concordia University. 

                            Since then, I have developed my career as an independent artist, delivering visually engaging and client-focused illustrations.

                <span class="v64_262">
                    My creative process is centered around collaboration with clients, ensuring their unique visions come to life through my work. I utilize both Procreate on iPad and Photoshop, with a strong emphasis on cel shading techniques to create crisp, dynamic visuals. 

                    Over the years, my style has evolved to incorporate elements of graphic novels, adding depth and narrative to my illustrations. Each project begins with a clear understanding of the client's needs, allowing me to translate their ideas into visually striking art.

                <span class="v97_1915">
                    My work is inspired by several prominent figures in the art and entertainment industries, most notably Stephen Bliss, renowned for his contributions to the Grand Theft Auto series, and Seung Eun Kim, known for his work on The Boondocks. 

                    Stephen Bliss has also played an influential role in my professional growth, offering support and mentorship throughout my career. Their creative approaches have helped shape my style and push me to continually evolve as an artist.

                <span class="v97_1929">Creating art is more than a profession for me; it is a passion that allows me to fully immerse myself in a world of creativity and focus. The act of drawing, and perfecting each illustration is a meditative process that I deeply enjoy. There is nothing more fulfilling than delivering artwork that resonates with both my clients and their audiences.
